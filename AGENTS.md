# AI Agent Instructions

These instructions are intended for AI tools and agents working on this
repository.

## Before you start: look at the open pull requests

List the open pull requests and check whether one already touches the file or
symbol you are about to change. If it does, work on something else.

Several agents run against this repository independently and cannot see each
other's work, so they converge on the same target often. One review across these
repositories found three byte-identical pull requests renaming a single import,
three separate attempts at splitting one function, and three sets of tests for
one endpoint — eleven of the thirty rejected pull requests were duplicates of
another open one.

`.github/workflows/overlapping-pr-check.yml` comments on a pull request when
another open one edits the same files. It does not block anything; overlap is
normal on a busy branch. Treat it as a prompt to check whether the two are doing
the same work, and to close the weaker one before both reach review.
